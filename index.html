            I am a recent graduate of Gonzaga University seeking a career in software development. I graduated in May 2020 with a BS in Physics and a minor in Computer Science. Please explore the rest of this page to learn more about me. Follow the links on the side to see my GitHub for smples of my coding, or to see my resume. Look below to learn about a project I am working on, and see some examples of techinical/scientific wrting I have done.

            Bids Eye is a website that I am working on for my dad. He works in construction and had the idea to create a website to analyze data for bids for construction jobs. Follow this <a href="http://www.bidseye.net/" target="_blank">link</a> to see the website. I was responsable for creating the website. Before this project I hadn't done much web development except for some basic HTML and CSS stuff. So I found <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/tracks/full-stack-ruby-on-rails" target="_blank">this course</a> on full stack web development using ruby on rails, and followed along to learn how to build this website for my dad. Through this corse I learned a lot about web development and developed a lot of very useful skills, and along the way I fell in love with web development.

              Samples of technical writing. These writings were either done as term papers for different physics classes or as lab reports for physics labs. Lab reports are also examples of some physics experiments that I have performed.
