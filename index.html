            I am a recent graduate of Gonzaga University seeking a career in software development. I graduated in May 2020 with a BS in Physics and a minor in Computer Science. Please explore the rest of this page to learn more about me. Follow the links on the side to see my GitHub for samples of my coding, or to see my resume. Look below to learn about a project I am working on, and see some examples of technical/scientific writing I have done.

              Bids Eye is a website that I am working on for my dad. He works in construction and had the idea to create a website to analyze data for bids for construction jobs. Follow this <a href="http://www.bidseye.net/" target="_blank">link</a> to see the website. I was responsible for creating the website. Before this project I hadn't done much web development except for some basic HTML and CSS stuff. So, I found <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/tracks/full-stack-ruby-on-rails" target="_blank">this course</a> on full stack web development using ruby on rails and followed along to learn how to build this website for my dad. Through this course I learned a lot about web development and developed a lot of very useful skills, and along the way I fell in love with web development.

              <strong>Some more technical information about the site.</strong> <br>
              The website is hosted on Heroku. I am using the devise ruby gem for user authentication. I have created models for users and admin users. Currently there are no real features for users. In the future I am planning on creating a subscription tier system, so that different tier users have different access to features. I created admin accounts for the data entry on the site. Currently, there isn't much content on the website. That is because I am still actively developing a lot of features to make the website more usable, and don't want to add too much data while I am still tweaking the database a lot. The core feature of analyzing the bids for a single job is there. I am currently working on features to make the site more usable, like searching and sorting so that a user can actually find the job they are interested in once there are hundreds of jobs listed on the site.

              Samples of technical writing. These writings were either done as term papers for different physics classes or as lab reports for physics labs. Lab reports are also examples of some physics experiments that I have performed.
